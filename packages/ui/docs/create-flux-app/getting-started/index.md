# Introduction

The `create-flux-app` package bootstraps a blank [Flux](https://fluxsocial.io) project.

It's a basic starting template that contains the fundamentals you'll need when creating apps for your Flux community.

## Prerequisites

Flux runs on top of [AD4M](https://ad4m.dev), a p2p framework where all data is stored and shared. In order to build a new Flux app you need to [download](https://ad4m.dev/download) and install AD4M.
