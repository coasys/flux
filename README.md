cachix use holochain-ci
```

Installing dependencies for flux and compiling holochain can be done with:

```
yarn install && yarn run get-bootstrap && yarn run build-holochain
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn run electron:serve
```

## Cleaning local state

The following commands will remove all installed ad4m languages (except defaults), holochain DNA's, ad4m did store & vuex store.

```
yarn run clean-state
```

## Holochain DNA's

This project makes use of the following holochain DNA's.

- [Social-Context](https://github.com/juntofoundation/Social-Context) link store DNA for persistence & signaling of links
- [ShortForm-Expression](https://github.com/juntofoundation/ad4m-languages/tree/master/shortform-expression) DNA for text posting (more expression types to follow soon)
- [Group-Expression](https://github.com/juntofoundation/ad4m-languages/tree/master/group-expression) DNA to store group metadata
- [Profile-Expression](https://github.com/jdeepee/profiles) DNA for basic profile registration (optional for each agent)
- [Language-Persistence](https://github.com/perspect3vism/language-persistence) DNA for the storing of language meta information under a given key
- [Neighbourhood-Persistence](https://github.com/perspect3vism/neighbourhood-language) DNA/ad4m language for storing neighbourhood objects
